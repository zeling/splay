Benchmarks
==========

I added several benchmarks to compare the splay based sequence with the finger-tree based sequence (well optimized one).

I only benchmarked the fromList function from the both sequence implementations, loads of other benchmarks
should be added later. 

See the [results](https://rawgit.com/zeling/splay/master/seq-bench.html) here.
